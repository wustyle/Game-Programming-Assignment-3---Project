NPC 1: First one the Character talks to 
Name: Jon

NPC: Seems like you're new here missy! The name's Jon! 
MC: I'm Lillia. Where am  I?
NPC: You're in Ravenhome! A small village on the outside of the Forbidden Forest. 
MC: Ravenhome? But I'm from St. Petersville. 
NPC: Haven't heard of there, honey. And you surely don't look like from here.
MC: How do I get of Ravenhome?
NPC: The only way out of here, sweetie, is through the Forbidden Forest. But no one ever leaves here, it's too dangerous to pass through.
MC: I have no choice, I must get back home.
NPC: Well, good luck but you will need some weapons if you want to get through the forest alive. Talk to Layla, she's the village chief. She can help you.
MC: Thanks, Jon.


NPC 2: Layla - Village Chief

MC: Hello, I'm Lillia, I need to go through the Forbidden Forest to go back home. Can you help me?
NPC: The Forbidden Forest? That's quite a scary place for a tiny person like you. 
MC: Please, I don't belong here. My parents must be worried about me.
NPC: Okay little one, I shall give you weapons and items that can assist you through the forest, but you must be careful, there are dangerous monsters that can pop up out of nowhere.
MC: Thank you, village chief. 
NPC: Press 'SHIFT' to attack.


NPC 3: Zeke - Forest guard

NPC: You're going into the forest? Be careful in there. Stock up on potions by killing enemies.
MC: Thank you!
