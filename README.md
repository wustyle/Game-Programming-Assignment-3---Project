# Interactive Game Prototype — Java

This project is a Java-based interactive game developed as part of a collaborative game programming course. Beyond a class assignment, it served as an opportunity to explore systems design in real-time interactive software and user feedback loops.

## Key Focus
- **Modular architecture:** separation of game logic, rendering, and input subsystems for scalability and maintainability.
- **Interactive behavior:** real-time processing of player actions and system responses.
- **Collaborative development:** practices for version control, issue tracking, and team coordination.

## Why this matters
Interactive systems such as games provide rich environments to study how software structure and user behavior co-evolve. This codebase demonstrates an understanding of core principles in human-centered system design and foundational software engineering.

## Future directions
This prototype could be extended with:
- analytics to study in-game user behavior,
- adaptive systems for difficulty balancing,
- integration with user feedback capture for research into engagement over time.
